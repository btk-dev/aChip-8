# Another CHIP-8 Interpreter

A CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++ inside Visual Studio

## What is CHIP-8

The CHIP-8 was an interpreted programming languaged created in the mid 1970s made to allow video games to be more easily programmed.
The CHIP-8 was revived in the early 1990s for use on graphing calculators and other lightweight computing devices.

### Why make a CHIP-8 Interpreter

The CHIP-8 is seen as the "Hello, World" of programming emulators and low-level machine code as the project includes translating
machine language hex-code and translating them into opcodes, or operations, and then defining what each opcode does. There are lots of
CHIP-8 interpreters online and the documentation is extensive making it an excellent beginner project for a foray into emulation and interpreters in general.

## To-Do

This interpreter is not yet fully implemented as there is no sound included yet. The sound for the CHIP-8 was a simple beep played when the sound-timer counted down to 1.
